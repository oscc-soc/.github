## Hi, OSCC SoC Project ðŸ‘‹
OSCC SoC Project includes an agile design, verification and integration framework that supports the rapid generation of SoC code after user code is accessed. In the future, we plan to integrate the SoC process into the cloud platform and break down the barriers between open source EDA tools, thereby ultimately realizing the entire chip design process from RTL to GDSII.
